## ‚ùå Step 1 ‚Äì Disable PipeWire

PipeWire is modern but can be unstable inside VMs. Let‚Äôs shut it down completely:

```bash
systemctl --user --now disable pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket
systemctl --user mask pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket
```
> Tip: This ensures PipeWire won‚Äôt auto-start in future sessions.

‚úÖ Step 2 ‚Äì Enable PulseAudio

Let‚Äôs bring back good old PulseAudio:
```
systemctl --user enable pulseaudio
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio
```

---

üîÅ Step 3 ‚Äì Reboot the VM
```
reboot
```
Give it a fresh start!


---

üéº Step 4 ‚Äì Test Your Audio

Run a test or just go to settings:
```
speaker-test -t wav -c 2
```
Or open:

`Settings ‚Üí Sound`

Make sure you‚Äôve selected the correct output device and that audio is smooth.

üõ†Ô∏è Optional: VMX Config Tweak

If audio is still weird, tweak your .vmx file:
`sound.virtualDev = "es1371"`
_or_
`sound.virtualDev = "hdaudio"`
This virtual device is known to behave better with PulseAudio.
