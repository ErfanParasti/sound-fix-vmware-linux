## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Setup

| Component           | Recommended Version |
|--------------------|---------------------|

## ‚ùå Step 1 ‚Äì Disable PipeWire

PipeWire is modern, but not VM-friendly. Shut it down completely:

```bash
systemctl --user --now disable pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket
systemctl --user mask pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket
```
> Tip: This ensures PipeWire won‚Äôt auto-start in future sessions.

‚úÖ Step 2 ‚Äì Enable PulseAudio

Let‚Äôs bring back good old PulseAudio:
```bash
systemctl --user enable pulseaudio
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio
```
---

üîÅ Step 3 ‚Äì Reboot the VM
```bash
reboot
```
Give it a fresh start!


---

üéº Step 4 ‚Äì Test Your Audio
```bash
speaker-test -t wav -c 2
```
Or go to:

Settings ‚Üí Sound

And make sure your output device is set correctly.

üõ†Ô∏è Optional: VMX Config Tweak

If audio is still buggy, edit your .vmx file:
`
sound.virtualDev = "es1371"
_or_
sound.virtualDev = "hdaudio"
`
These virtual devices are often more compatible with PulseAudio.
