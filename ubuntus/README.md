# 🎧 Fix Audio Glitches in Ubuntu VM (VMware)

> **Tired of audio crackling, stuttering, or vanishing in your Ubuntu VM?**  
> Here's a clean, proven fix that **restores smooth sound** by switching from PipeWire back to the old, stable PulseAudio inside VMware.

## ⚙️ Supported Setup

| Component           | Recommended Version |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Ubuntu             | 24.10 (or newer)    |

## ❌ Step 1 – Disable PipeWire

PipeWire is modern but can be unstable inside VMs. Let’s shut it down completely:

```bash
systemctl --user --now disable pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket
systemctl --user mask pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket
```
> Tip: This ensures PipeWire won’t auto-start in future sessions.

✅ Step 2 – Enable PulseAudio

Let’s bring back good old PulseAudio:
```
systemctl --user enable pulseaudio
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio
```

---

🔁 Step 3 – Reboot the VM
```
reboot
```
Give it a fresh start!


---

🎼 Step 4 – Test Your Audio

Run a test or just go to settings:
```
speaker-test -t wav -c 2
```
Or open:

`Settings → Sound`

Make sure you’ve selected the correct output device and that audio is smooth.

🛠️ Optional: VMX Config Tweak

If audio is still weird, tweak your .vmx file:
`sound.virtualDev = "es1371"`
_or_
`sound.virtualDev = "hdaudio"`
This virtual device is known to behave better with PulseAudio.
